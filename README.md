<h1>Ticketing-System</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I will be showcasing my experience with a ticketing system using the Zendesk web-based SaaS tool. I will first launch the tool, select tickets, answer tickets, and categorize them based on priority, type, etc. There is also multiple other "SAMPLE" tickets shown within the solved tab in the first image.
