I will first launch the tool, select tickets, answer tickets, and categorize them based on priority, type, etc. There is also multiple other "SAMPLE" tickets shown within the solved tab in the first image.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
During this lab I was able to practice some of the fundamentals of working the Help Desk position. Making use of the SaaS user interface, and navigating my way to the company's knowledge base. I practiced viewing tickets, assigning ticket priority, type, and status. I finished off by resovling the tickets using the company's knowledge base.
